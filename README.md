**Deep Learning — Spring 2026**

Age Classification on the given Dataset

| | |
|---|---|
| **Phase I Deadline** | **06-03-2026 11:59 PM** |
| **Phase II Deadline** | **15-03-2026 11:59 PM** |

---

## Phase 1

### Overview

Binary age classification (Young = 0, Old = 1) using a **ResNet-18** trained from scratch on 18,332 face images.

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Place the dataset
#    Download dataset.zip from Google Drive, unzip it so the layout is:
#    dataset/
#      train/
#        0/   (9,166 Young images)
#        1/   (9,166 Old images)
#      valid/  (134 images, flat)
#      valid_labels.csv
```

### How to Run

```bash
# Quick sanity check (2 epochs, small batch — verifies pipeline end-to-end)
python train.py --mode quick

# Full training run (30 epochs by default)
python train.py --mode full

# Final submission run (trains on train + valid combined)
python train.py --mode final

# Override hyper-parameters as needed
python train.py --mode full --epochs 50 --lr 5e-4 --batch_size 32
```

### Expected Outputs

All artefacts are saved to **`results/phase1/`**:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `saved_model.pth` | Full model checkpoint (`torch.save(model, ...)`) |
| `best_model.pth` | Best validation checkpoint (only in `full` mode) |
| `metrics.csv` | Per-epoch loss, train acc, val acc, LR |
| `loss_curve.png` | Training loss plot |
| `accuracy_curve.png` | Train / validation accuracy plot |
| `config.json` | Run configuration for reproducibility |

### Verify Submission Format

```bash
python evaluate_submission_student.py \
    --model_path results/phase1/saved_model.pth \
    --model_file model_class.py \
    --data_dir dataset
```

### Submission Deliverables

Rename for submission:
- `model_class.py` → `roll_no.py`
- `results/phase1/saved_model.pth` → `roll_no.pth`
- One-page PDF report → `roll_no.pdf`

### Run Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_phase1.py -v
```

### Reproducibility

- Fixed random seed (`SEED = 42`) for Python, NumPy, and PyTorch
- `torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True`
- All hyper-parameters logged to `results/phase1/config.json`

### Assumptions & Notes

1. **Dataset not included in repo** — download `dataset.zip` from Google Drive and extract to `dataset/`.
2. The assignment says "You may modify anything except the optimizer" — we use **AdamW** as provided in the starter notebook.
3. For the **final submission**, set `--mode final` to retrain on train + valid combined, as instructed.
4. The model is saved with `torch.save(model, path)` (full model, not `state_dict`) for compatibility with `evaluate_submission_student.py`.

## 1. Overview

In this assignment, you will build an image classifier that predicts the **age** (young vs. old) of a person from a face photograph. You are given a training set of 18,332 face images from the given dataset, split evenly between two classes.

Your goal is simple: **achieve the highest classification accuracy on the hidden test set.**

Your model will be evaluated by the instructor on a hidden test set, and your accuracy will be publicly posted post Phase I.

> **Why this matters:**
> Real-world classifiers often look great on training data but fail in production. This assignment will push you to think beyond training accuracy.

---

## 2. Dataset

### Description

The dataset consists of aligned, cropped face images at 256×256 resolution. Each image belongs to one of two classes:

| Label | Class |
|:-----:|-------|
| 0     | Young |
| 1     | Old   |

### What you receive

- **Training images** (18,332 total): organised in class sub-folders.
- **Validation images** (134 total)
- **Validation labels** (`valid_labels.csv`): ground-truth labels for the validation images, so you can compute your own validation accuracy locally.
- **Starter code**: a training notebook and model definition file.
- **Evaluation script**: to verify your submission format before submitting.

```
dataset/
  train/
    0/        # 9,166 images (class 0 - Young)
    1/        # 9,166 images (class 1 - Old)
  valid/      # 134 images (flat, no sub-folders)
  valid_labels.csv
```

### Download

Download the dataset from the link at the top of this document. The validation images and labels are provided so you can evaluate locally. The **test set is hidden** — only the instructor has access.

## 3. Your Task

Train a deep neural network to classify face images as *young* or *old*.

You have considerable freedom in **how** you train your model. You may use foundation models as a *reference* (e.g., to extract embeddings or auxiliary features).

The only hard constraint is the model architecture backbone (see below).

### ⚠️ Constraint: Architecture and Training

> - You **must** use the **ResNet-18** architecture as provided by `torch` (see the starter notebook).
> - You may make architectural modifications, provided that you do **not** change the depth or the core ResNet-18 layers.
> - You **must train** the ResNet-18 model yourself. The use of a pretrained ResNet-18 (or any other pretrained backbone) for the final model is **not allowed**.
> - You may use pretrained foundation models *only as references* (e.g., for embeddings or guidance), and they must **not** be used as the primary model.
> - You are **not allowed** to train multiple models.

### What you CAN change

- Learning rate, weight decay, batch size, number of epochs, optimizer.
- Loss function (any suitable loss function or create your own loss function).
- Training strategy.
- You may use **any paper, blog, or online resource** for ideas.

### What you CANNOT change

- You must train on the **provided training data only** (no external face datasets).
- You must **not** attempt to reverse-engineer, look up, or hard-code test labels.

### ⚠️ Important: Save the full model, not just weights

```python
# use lower-case for roll_no!
# CORRECT
torch.save(model, 'roll_no.pth')

# WRONG — do NOT do this
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'roll_no.pth')
```

### The `roll_no.py` file

Your `.py` file must contain the class definition used by the saved model. When Python unpickles a `torch.save(model, ...)` file, it needs the original class to be importable.

**Example** (if you use the provided ResNet-18 starter):

```python
import torch.nn as nn
from torchvision import models

def build_model(num_classes=2):
    model = models.resnet18(weights=None)
    model.fc = nn.Linear(512, num_classes)
    return model
```

If you define a **custom model**, put the full class definition in this file:

```python
### MUST USE RESNET 18 as BACKBONE!!
import torch.nn as nn

class MyAgeClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # ... your layers ...

    def forward(self, x):
        # ... your forward pass ...
        return x
```

### Self-check before submitting

Use the provided evaluation script to verify your submission:

```bash
python evaluate_submission_student.py \
    --model_path roll_no.pth \
    --model_file roll_no.py \
    --data_dir dataset/ \
    --valid
```

If this runs without errors and prints an accuracy, your submission is correctly formatted.

## 5. Evaluation & Leaderboard

- **Metric:** Classification accuracy (%).
- Your model is evaluated on hidden test images held by the instructor.
- **Final ranking** is based on the **hidden test set** accuracy, revealed after the deadline.

> **Hint:**
> Check train and valid images and see if there is some pattern; see the accuracy of train and valid set — what do you observe? Is it supposed to happen?

## 6. Phase I: Model Development

| | |
|---|---|
| **Duration** | 11 days from release |
| **Deadline** | **06-03-2026 11:59 PM** |
| **Deliverable** | `roll_no.py` + `roll_no.pth` + `roll_no.pdf` |

In Phase I, your objective is to develop the best age classifier you can with all the exploration that you desire.

1. **Start** from the provided starter notebook and model definition.
2. **Train** your model on the training set. You may modify anything except the optimizer.
3. **Evaluate** locally using the validation set and the provided evaluation script.
4. Once you are satisfied with your approach, **before final submission train the entire model again — this time include the valid data provided to you!**
5. Prepare a **one-page PDF report** explaining your approach. *Reports exceeding one page will not be evaluated.*
6. **Submit** the following files by the deadline:
   - `roll_no.py`
   - `roll_no.pth`
   - `roll_no.pdf` (one page)

Leaderboard and best performing models will be released on 8th March.

## 7. Phase II: Analysis & Improvement

| | |
|---|---|
| **Duration** | 7 days after Phase I results are released |
| **Deadline** | **15-03-2026 11:59 PM** |
| **Deliverables** | `roll_no.py` + `roll_no.pth` + `roll_no.pdf` |

After Phase I closes, we will release:

- The **best-performing model** and its training code from Phase I.
- The **final leaderboard** with test-set accuracies.

Your task in Phase II is twofold:

1. **Improve:** Build a model that achieves *higher accuracy* than the released best model. You may use the released code as a starting point or develop an entirely new approach.

2. **Analyse:** Write a **short report (1 page, PDF)** addressing the following questions:
   - What techniques did you use to improve your model, and why do they help?
   - Compare your Phase I and Phase II approaches.
